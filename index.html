                Hi respected readers, my name is Sion Paul and i'm an international student at algonquin college undertaking interactive media design. I really like this program due to the web development parnt and videography part of the course as its something that has always been an 
                interest to me , Completed my higher secondary in india but am really enthusiastic to pursue my studies here in canada as i really like the friendliness  of this country.Besides canada i've had the chance to enjoy the beautiful cultures of africa as i did my primary schooling in tanzania . My studies apart i enjoy taking video, photographs and developing websites so why not make it a career.
            </p>
